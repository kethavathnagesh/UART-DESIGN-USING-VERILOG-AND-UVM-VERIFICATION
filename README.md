# UART-DESIGN-USING-VERILOG-AND-UVM-VERIFICATION
The objective is to design and verify a UART module using System Verilog and UVM, ensuring  efficient and reusable testbenches.
UARTs enable serial communication using start, data, parity, and stop bits, with a baud rate generator, transmitter, and receiver. Widely used in various industries, UART technology is cost-effective, stable, and reliable.
